# Main Gameplay
- Keeping rhythm is crucial to the game. With out it the player cannot attack or use the dash action to deal with the onslot of enemies coming their way. Enemies spawn -every 3.5 seconds in a random point on the screen and will quickly ball up. 
- Enemies are not required to be in sync with the music and my attack freely. So watch if you get swarmed and attack out of sync. 
- The player has a health bar which comes with a total of 4 hits (for the current build). Once the health bar is depleted the player is dead and the end screen displays.
