# Current Build and Improvements
Hi, this is a technical break down of how the program works, where resources are located, and how to improve apon it.

## Coded in C#
For those who are more familiar with Java or C/C++, C# is not too different and will most likely find it easy to understand. There are also several resources on how to write software for Unity in the forms of youtube videos and documentation, found [here](https://docs.unity.com/). 

## Development Enviroment
For future dolphins working on this project, this project was made using Jet Brains Rider IDE. Here are the main draws to using Rider:
- It's free to sign up and download if you are a college student or professor. 
  - linking your college email to get access to all of Jet Brains software development tools
- Rider has plugins that link to Unity and Github
  - These plugins saved lots of time linking a pushing to this repository 
  - The only downside is that only the code is pushed through the plugin, you would still need to use gitbash or gitUI
