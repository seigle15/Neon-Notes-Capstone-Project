# Neon-Notes-Capstone-Project
by Sean Eigle - Class of 2022
Neon Notes is a 2D top-down rhythm game with pixel art with a futuristic cyber theme. Unlike BPM or NecroDancer our product focuses on a balance between movement and changing rhythms that keeps players on their toes. The player can input actions with accordance with the Rhythm of the music, failure to be on beat results in no action.
